The Avengers surprised San Francisco and now there's rubble where the Golden Gate Bridge stood. How many Legos would it take to rebuild the bridge you ask? 

To you I say only 1! Stop don't close this window and listen to my simple argument.

A few assumptions on my part:
1) The team consists of any previous or current members.
2) I am able to reach the team before they depart
3) I have a Lego in my pocket. Who doesn't?

Rebuilding a bridge as large as the Golden Gate Bridge would not only be expensive process, but also an extremely time consuming one at that. The amount of material needed to rebuild a bridge that large is massive.

Is there a way to rebuild the bridge quickly and efficiently?
The Avengers are there, why not use them to fix the bridge. Using someone as powerful as an Avenger would make things much easier and quicker.

What resources are currently available?
There is a 2x8 plate Lego in my pocket as well as the Avengers.

How can the resources be used to get the job done?
Hank's Pym particles can grow the Lego to cover the length that the original bridge. Iron Man could then take the extremely light Lego and place it where the bridge used to be, making sure to connect it.

How will it be refined?
Scarlet Witch, with her ability to warp reality, can change the density of the Lego as well as the shape to make it match the original bridge.
